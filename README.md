# AVL-Tree-Implementation

This repository contains a C++ implementation of an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree, a self-balancing binary search tree.

## AVL Tree Overview

An AVL tree is a binary search tree with the additional property that the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This ensures that the tree remains balanced, preventing it from becoming skewed and maintaining efficient search, insert, and delete operations with a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

## Features

- **Insertion**: Adding a new node to the AVL tree while maintaining balance.
- **Deletion**: Removing a node from the AVL tree while ensuring balance is preserved.
- **Search**: Finding a specific key in the AVL tree.
- **Traversal**: In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals for accessing nodes in different orders.
- **Count Occurences**: Number of occurences of a particular element
- **Balancing**: Rotations to maintain the balance property of the AVL tree.
